# Summoning, Pods, and Isolation

How work comes into existence in Hecate: the Guide summons; the Guardian admits; the
harness allocates microVM pods, volumes, permissions, and network; agents run inside a
hard boundary and reach everything — ledger, workspace, tools, providers — over the pod
network.

Terminology follows `../../CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. The summon

A summon is a **claim**: an orchestrating agent (the Guide; the autoscaler as a
system participant) requests a workload; **the scheduler executes it** and
testifies the allocation; the issuer monitors and evaluates. In the spirit of
creating a Kubernetes Deployment:

1. **Compose** — the Guide chooses the agent set for the intent (an architect pod for a
   design conversation; inspector + engineer for a bug fix; a lone engineer for simple
   work; several engineers for parallelizable work), informed where useful by consulting
   the agents themselves.
2. **Admit** — the Guardian soft-gates the summon (§7).
3. **Allocate** — pods (one agent per pod, possibly many pods per summon), VFS volumes,
   permissions, and network endpoints/policies.
4. **Assign** — each agent binds to its pod with its role's guest image, skill set, and
   model configuration, resolved and pinned at summon time. Configuration changes reach
   live work only via handoff — never by mutating a running pod.
5. **Validate** — health and correctness: the pod boots, the agent is reachable, its
   mounts and network policy are live. A summon that cannot validate fails loudly.

Summons persist as **claims** on the ledger — the summon is directed work with
validations (Guardian admission among them), its testament records what was allocated,
and teardown is its terminal lifecycle. Everything else about a summon (resource
telemetry, scheduling detail) is logs, not ledger.

## 2. The isolation stack

**A pod is a microVM running one agent.** The VM boundary is the isolation guarantee —
hardware virtualization, a guest kernel, and a device surface the host polices. This is
the hard boundary Sylk's process-level discipline clumsily approximated.

Decision (ADR-0001): Hecate builds on the **libkrun family, forked and owned in-tree**:

- **Linux**: KVM backend (upstream libkrun).
- **macOS**: Hypervisor.framework backend (upstream libkrun; Apple Silicon).
- **Windows**: Windows Hypervisor Platform backend, adopted from the 2026 WHP lineage
  (A3S Box / SmolVM) and co-maintained by us.

We fork and maintain all of it. We do not fear the complexity, and where we can improve
the stack we do. libkrun is a *library* VMM, which is what makes the single-binary
product shape possible: `hecate` embeds the runtime; there is no daemon requirement.

**The boundary contract is VMM-agnostic** so any leg can be swapped for a native
platform VM if a backend stalls:

- Linux guest, one dual-arch image family (x86_64 + aarch64).
- **virtio-fs** for workspace and projection mounts.
- **vsock** for control (agent runtime ↔ harness).
- **All network egress terminates in a host user-space network stack**
  (gvproxy/TSI-style). There is no guest path to the network that does not traverse a
  host process — this is where the Guardian's network hard-block physically lives.

The **full agent loop runs in-guest** — LLM client included. All egress (provider APIs,
ledger protocol, MCP) crosses the virtual network where the Guardian polices it; no
host-side agent code exists that could bypass the boundary.

OS-level sandboxes (bubblewrap / Seatbelt / AppContainer) exist only as an explicitly
labeled **degraded mode**, never the default boundary, and a run under them is marked
non-hermetic to its consumers.

## 3. Guest images

- One minimal Linux image family, dual-arch, with Hyper-V enlightenments compiled in
  (harmless elsewhere) so the identical image boots on all three hosts.
- **Role-specific images**: the Engineer's carries toolchains, test runners, and LSPs;
  the Inspector's carries analyzers only; the Archivalist's carries debuggers,
  profilers, and tracing tools; the Designer's carries media tooling; the TS/Python
  skill runtimes ship in the images of agents whose skills need them.
- Images are content-addressed and pinned into the summon. "Did this agent's world
  change" is a hash comparison.

## 4. Networking

Entirely network-driven inter-agent and inter-pod communication. Two protocols ride the
virtual network (ADR-0002, `LEDGER.md` §7):

- **The claims plane** — ledger operations, delta streaming, summon control, health —
  speaks Hecate's own ground-up dual-stack UDP/TCP protocol.
- **The tool plane** — skills and tools, internal and external — speaks MCP
  (`SKILLS.md`).

Per-pod network identity and policy are allocated at summon time. Default posture is
deny: a pod reaches the harness endpoints it was granted and nothing else; external
egress is a Guardian-policed grant. The Guardian may sever any flow mid-stream; policy
revocation tears down affected parked turns with a reason (signals carry reasons —
`LEDGER.md` §5).

## 5. VFS volumes and the guest mount

The host-side VFS remains the single write authority; guests see **views**.

- Each pod's volume projects into the guest as a **POSIX mount** (virtio-fs), served
  host-side from the pod's overlay. Toolchains just work: compilers, test runners, and
  linters operate on ordinary files.
- Writes land in the overlay **server-side**, where budgets, capture, and Guardian
  policy live. The guest never holds workspace bytes the host didn't serve it.
- The serving cut is the path-based, stateless namespace interface Sylk already proved
  (Stat / ListDir / ReadFile / Write / handle layer) — now served over virtio-fs instead
  of FUSE-in-process.
- The guest mount **deletes Sylk's compensation machinery**: shebang rewriting at
  extraction time, dynamic-linker interposers, and heuristic argv/env/shell path
  translation existed only because processes saw host paths. In-guest, the canonical
  paths are simply real.
- VFS is in-RAM with **no disk spill**, bounded by derived budgets (§8). Layers: disk
  (committed baseline) → green (increment-validated, `LEDGER.md` §6) → per-pod overlays.
  The Designer's volumes sit outside this versioned chain entirely.

## 6. The tool substrate

Hecate adopts Sylk's Tool VFS design — the part that was designed right and never wired
— as the way external tooling (packages, toolchains, libraries) exists:

- **Content-addressed store**: BLAKE3-keyed blobs, manifests as path→blob indexes,
  install-once/share-many. Recipes are content; the runtime is universal — the substrate
  knows how to fetch, verify, extract, build, sandbox, project, cache, and dedupe, and
  does not know what any artifact is for. Adding an ecosystem is writing recipes and a
  resolver adapter, not teaching the runtime a language.
- **Deterministic builds**: recipe identity is a content hash; recipe → manifest is a
  function under the determinism profile; hermetic build sandboxes are deny-first (no
  network, clamped env), keyed by target rather than host.
- **Lockfile**: per-session, WAL-durable, append-only witnesses per pod; no silent
  upgrades; side-by-side versions are nearly free under dedup.
- **Projection**: a pod's resolved tool set composes into its guest mount alongside the
  workspace view; substrate paths are immutable (a "write" to content-addressed bytes is
  meaningless and is refused).
- **The three Guardian gates**, now real code, not doc prose:
  1. **Provision gate** — before any bytes are fetched: resolved package, source,
     hashes, license, full transitive closure, provenance/attestations. The Guardian
     inventories the closure, never trusts the author's manifest.
  2. **Sandbox capability gate** — every spawn: proposed mounts, network policy,
     resource caps, purpose; verdicts include APPROVED_WITH_CAVEATS (capability
     downgrade).
  3. **Disk fallback gate** — consented, hash-pinned host-tool use, permanently tagged,
     never promotable to substrate-canonical.
- Supply-chain violations are loud: hash mismatch → refusal plus a durable violation
  event. Verification happens on every fetch, not first fetch.

Sylk's implementation lessons are binding here (`PLATFORM.md` §8): no half-wired gates,
no advisory caches nobody consults, no "registered but returns not-implemented"
extractors. A capability ships wired or it does not ship.

## 7. Guardian admission

The summon soft gate, in the spirit of a Kubernetes admission controller:

- **Known agent type** — the roster is closed; a summon naming anything else is refused
  structurally.
- **Resource sanity** — pod count, volume budgets, and rate are checked against derived
  ceilings; a malicious or runaway summoner cannot DoS the system by spinning up pods.
- **Capability tier** — read-only/advisory pods admit freely; write- or exec-capable
  pods carry a Guardian validation on the summon claim, and the Guardian's judgment
  (per SafetyPolicy) decides whether the user is also asked.
- Soft-gate rules are bounded and declared: the Guardian may deny within them or request
  more evidence a bounded number of times; it cannot stall a summon indefinitely.

After admission, the Scribes watch: each agent's Scribe reports to the Guardian, which
analyzes conduct continuously. Skill and tool invocation gating (per-call, risk-based,
auto-approvable) is the Guardian's ongoing authority, distinct from admission.

## 8. Budgets

Every ceiling is **derived from physical anchors** — system memory, volume allocation,
pod count — never a literal constant. Volume budgets derive from summon-time allocation;
the Designer's disk-overflow threshold derives from its volume budget; provisioning
concurrency derives from substrate-global caps. Exhaustion produces durable, typed
signals (budget_exhausted is a counted outcome, not an error string), and the Guardian
is the primary consumer of pressure telemetry.

## 9. Health validation and lifecycle

- Summon-time: boot, reachability, mount and network liveness — validated before the
  summon claim's admission validations can pass.
- Runtime: the health plane (`PLATFORM.md` §5) feeds each agent's Scribe; handoffs
  (context: unilateral scribe-initiated; performance: Guardian-approved) replace agent
  instances without losing work — parked turns and claims survive by construction
  because they are ledger state, not process state.
- Teardown: never before the work is committed — pipeline lifecycle is independent of
  disk commit, and rejection/correction are not terminal for a pod's volumes.
  Suspend/resume captures durable state only; a resumed pod re-resolves secrets and
  nothing else.

## 10. Topology

**Single binary** (ADR-0004): `hecate` is the terminal client and the runtime in one
process — libkrun-as-library makes this real, not a daemon hiding in a trench coat.

Internally the client and runtime keep a **seam** that speaks the real wire protocol
over three bindings — in-memory (default), unix socket, remote — carrying the same
frames, delta streams, and cursors in all three (ADR-0004). Sylk's hardest retrofit —
a bus welded inside an agent package, a UI holding 25 live pointers into the runtime —
is the cost of not having this seam; Hecate pays the near-zero price up front.

## 11. Local is distributed, degenerate

Hecate is a high-velocity harness that runs local-same-as-distributed. The rules that
make that true rather than aspirational:

- **One machinery, degenerate locally.** The seam's in-memory binding, the ledger's
  single-replica consensus group (`LEDGER.md` §8), and single-node placement are the
  *same code* as their distributed forms with smaller parameters. No local-only
  shortcuts, no distributed-only modules bolted on later.
- **Colocation units.** The session truth plane — ledger home, merge serializer, green,
  disk flusher — is one colocation unit, placed whole on one node. Each pod colocates
  with its own volume server. Pods otherwise place anywhere: cross-pod interaction is
  already exclusively network protocol (claims plane + MCP), and the streaming merge
  gate is distribution-native by construction — increments travel as ledger artifacts
  regardless of which node produced them. Summoning gains a placement step that is
  trivial on one node and real on many; the summon contract does not change.
- **Identity and credentials.** Every message carries a composite principal
  (`user/session/agent/pod`) — the on-behalf-of chain lives in the identity, stamped
  where the turn is minted. Agents never hold user credentials: pods receive scoped,
  short-lived tokens minted at the runtime boundary, locally and remotely alike.
  Provider gateways sit behind the same host chokepoint in both modes, so token
  accounting sees every request either way.
- **Velocity is a requirement, not a hope.** MicroVM summons must not cost seconds:
  warm pod pools per role, VM snapshot/restore for near-instant resume, and
  content-addressed image caching keep summon-to-ready inside a derived budget that is
  measured continuously — a summon that misses its budget is a health-plane signal,
  not an accepted cost. Failing a budget locally is the same defect as failing it on a
  cluster.
