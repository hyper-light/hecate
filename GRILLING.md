# Hecate Design Tree — Grilling Ledger (resume file)

Snapshot: 2026-08-16, end of spec-level session 2. Resume from here. An item is
**settled** only when its spec was shown and accepted; drafted-but-unaccepted
specs are **on the table**; branches without specs are **open**.

## Standing rules (user-established; enforce every exchange)

1. **Ledger scope test**: the ledger = proof of work — claims, testaments,
   validations, artifacts, nothing else. Config→config; ops→logs; working
   state→its owning service. (User corrected twice; never again.)
2. **One decision per exchange, worked to settlement.** No bundle ratifications.
   Assent without a shown spec = direction only, spec owed. Specs are shown
   IN-MESSAGE before any file is written (violated once with the Sibyl draft —
   deleted and re-presented; do not repeat).
3. **Research before argument** for every substantial decision; receipts inline.
4. **Maximal test**: every design examined for maximally correct/robust/
   performant/efficient at BOTH laptop and Meta scale; laptop is always the
   derived degenerate of one formula family — no modes, ever.
5. **No ambient anything crosses a session fence.** Cross-session = same-user
   Archivalist recall or Guardian-staged registry publication only.
6. **Agents never allocate**: they issue claims; machinery executes; issuers
   monitor/evaluate. Judgment above, deterministic consequence at chokepoints.
7. **Coined names are provisional** until mechanisms settle and the glossary
   captures them. "Workspace" is RETIRED (grep-gated) → lineage / session /
   work volume.
8. **User review is a first-class gate** (default prompt for materialization).
9. Constants derive from anchors with derivations at definition sites; floors
   ratchet from first CI baseline; observe-mode-first for any new influence.

## SETTLED (spec shown + accepted)

| Spec | Content anchor |

| Architecture set | `docs/architecture/{AGENTS,SUMMONING,LEDGER,SKILLS,PLATFORM}.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, ADRs 0001–0005 — amended throughout this session (open roster/offices, Arbiter, summon-as-claim, retirement, work volume, ten agents) |

## ON THE TABLE (drafted + shown; awaiting acceptance — settle ONE at a time)

1. `docs/specs/SESSIONS.md` — whole (lineage first-class, per-session pods,
   three-layer landing engine + jj conflict algebra, conflict deposits, review
   gates, 6-stage evaluation funnel with numbers, lifecycle/churn/GC, floors).
   **Verdict UNBLOCKED 2026-08-16** — Branch 21 settled; §3's contract is now
   backed by SERVING.md. All four held riders EXECUTED with the SERVING.md
   commit: (i) cost-ledger line (landing engine = second merge machine);
   (ii) VFS.md op-log clause; (iii) CONTEXT.md Landing + Conflict value;
   (iv) ADR-0005 amendment + §5 cross-ref (one law: no automatic resolution
   of concurrent code edits anywhere; dispositions differ only by author
   liveness — bounce vs value). Verdict re-presented; awaiting accept.
2. `docs/specs/LEDGER_CORE.md` — + sub-decisions (a) apply-on-ack, (b) no outbox
   (log+cursors), (c) event-carried score snapshots.
3. `docs/specs/AUTOSCALING.md` — + sub-decisions (i) ratio-law-only,
   (ii) scale-to-zero for idle daemons.
4. `docs/specs/REGISTRY.md` v2 — syllium-informed; ref-CAS sole mutation; watch
   API; schema-doc kinds; §4b materialization path.
5. `docs/specs/SKILLS_API.md` — one derive → five artifacts; S6 surface counts.
6. `docs/specs/HEALTH.md` — one plane (Sylk ran four); no authority.
7. `docs/specs/FOREST.md` — Z-set field engine, ACT-R/FSRS/MMAS/Parunak/PPR
   dynamics, primary-by-construction, observe-mode value gate, session-isolated
   (global-forest tier DELETED as data-leak; user correction).

## OPEN BRANCHES (no spec)

- **14 Handoff detection math** — context accounting (provider usage vs local
  estimate; what counts), threshold derivation, GP/UCB vs changepoint (CUSUM/
  EWMA) for performance dropoff, evidence-bundle assembly. RESEARCH FIRST.
- **15 Steering machinery** — mid-task user guidance: interrupts as
  supersession, priority hints as claim fields, turn-level injection.
- **17 Remote client + terminal** — seam remote binding: attach/detach, view
  subjects (pane=subscription), input lease mechanics, cursor resume, offline
  queue, presentation plane rendering from deltas.
- **18 Continuity + conversation** — carry-forward/recall over the archive
  (same-user path partially shaped in SESSIONS/FOREST), Guide conversation model.
- **20 Consensus + fault matrix** — direction argued, UNRATIFIED: per-session
  Raft-family groups (5 improvements over hyperscale: homogeneous nodes,
  pods-never-gossip liveness, work-liveness-to-ledger, consensus-as-pure-log,
  AD-52 baseline). Raft-implementation-practice research owed, then
  CONSENSUS.md + FAULTS.md (failure×obligation matrix, crash-fault scope).
- **21 FS implementation (the serving machine)** — **SETTLED 2026-08-16**:
  spec `docs/specs/SERVING.md` accepted whole; decision record below stands
  as history. OPENED 2026-08-16; user
  critique: EdenFS/CitC borrowings named but machinery never designed, and the
  laptop→fleet scale story unstated ("sharding — how?"). Decisions to settle,
  research-first: (a) write/witness model — **RATIFIED 2026-08-16: journal-
  first (Option C)**. The witness journal IS a session WAL log: FUSE_WRITE
  appends a content-bearing op, group-committed before the reply (ack = the
  witness; power-fail-safe, beats EdenFS's process-crash-only). Overlay =
  derived, rebuildable state (crash recovery = replay; no fsck). Epochs seal
  into CDC/BLAKE3 CAS snapshots at increments (OSTree/f4 demotion). Manifests
  keep the one-bit dirtiness contract (hash = clean | journal-ref = dirty).
  eg-walker op logs derived by diff at seal time, off the hot path, version-
  pinned (satisfies the SESSIONS.md VFS rider). Journal = FS-service working
  state, NOT ledger. Spec owed with the branch spec; (b) overlay
  representation — **ACCEPTED 2026-08-16**: exactly two representations.
  Mutable = per-pod log-structured work-volume overlay (per-volume journal +
  extent index; single authority; cross-volume reads unrepresentable; volume
  outlives pod, re-binds on handoff; no index checkpoint — rebuild bounded by
  seal cadence, checkpoint is the tripwire; dirty reads = FUSE_READ copies,
  DAX-for-dirty REJECTED as cross-volume leak via interleaved segments).
  Immutable = manifests-over-CAS everywhere else (baseline, green chain,
  seals, tools). Green = manifest chain, no journal: merge gate EXTENDS
  (never writes) — chain record (version, manifest hash, increment refs) is
  green's only WAL touch; serving instances compiled with no write path
  (EROFS structural); all-DAX read-only, cross-pod page sharing; pods pin
  green@version, re-bind at increment boundaries via manifest-diff targeted
  invalidations (EdenFS checkout steal). Scratch volume role rider on VFS.md
  (redirect paths unwitnessed, pod-local, die with pod). Increment submission
  forces guest writeback drain (FUSE_FSYNC sweep) before seal; (c) metadata
  model — **ACCEPTED 2026-08-16**: inode identity law = (volume, path-entry),
  monotonic per volume, stable for the VOLUME's lifetime (table serializes +
  re-binds with the volume — takeover steal; handoff invisible to (dev,inode)
  tooling); content identity = manifest-entry hash, re-bind = hash swap under
  stable inodes + targeted invalidations only (manifest diff), generation
  numbers guard reuse; manifest entries carry (type, mode, size, BLAKE3) —
  stat/readdir/ENOENT answered from manifest, zero fetch, no negative cache
  (manifests complete); tree nodes = CAS chunks, lazy on first readdir;
  content on open (presence check batched → DAX or extent read); digest
  xattr contract: BLAKE3 xattr on clean files, ABSENT while dirty (honest),
  feeds build tools + scheduler memoization; caching split: green/tools =
  infinite TTL + explicit invalidation at re-bind, work volume = writeback
  mode (sole-writer guest coherence, batches witnessed writes); prefetch =
  template eager sets at bind + sampled-access-derived glob profiles
  (observe-first, EdenFS ~1500-glob receipt), crawl detection → bounded
  cache-fill (SES7); (d) DAX policy — read-mostly
  windows; witnessing enforceability VERIFIED via research (per-inode
  dax=inode + FUSE_ATTR_DAX + EROFS on WRITE mappings, shipped mechanisms);
  REMAINING resolved — **(d) ACCEPTED 2026-08-16**: mapping engine = one
  trait, two modes — splice (zero-copy page share) | managed-window (boot-
  mapped window, daemon copies; zero runtime hypervisor calls; the one mode
  where DAX + full witnessing could coexist); KVM = splice, HVF = splice
  behind boot capability probe w/ managed fallback, WHP = managed until
  proven; window = 2 MiB × derived peak hot ranges + 20-range reclaim
  headroom, ceilinged by ~1.6% guest-RAM tax — all anchored in kernel
  constants; **(e) ACCEPTED 2026-08-16**: own FUSE-over-virtio protocol layer
  + backend trait native to hecate-rt, in-process device in the libkrun fork
  (vhost-user rejected: process model + sync trait + ENOSYS DAX); borrow
  structure not code (virtiofsd dispatch shape + zero-copy seam, libkrun
  3-platform mapping paths, EdenFS inode discipline); advertise multiqueue
  (5.5× receipt, Linux ≥6.10 guests); (f) scale topology —
  **ACCEPTED 2026-08-16**: one weighted-HRW placement function over a
  versioned, fenced host-inventory map (consensus-owned; consumes Branch 20's
  API, doesn't own it); chunk-groups as placement unit (count = devices ×
  target-groups-per-device ≈100–200, Ceph anchor) + explicit upmap-style
  exception table; R-way replication on the live tier, R_eff = min(R_target,
  distinct failure domains), degenerate durability LOUD (MinIO SNSD wording);
  erasure only in the Archivalist cold tail (f4); cache = DAX → host
  pack-volume store (append-only + in-RAM index, Haystack) → HRW peer →
  shield/origin, single-flight at every layer, popularity-triggered
  mirroring, never rehash-on-failure (Gutter); mutable = state-follows-
  compute (primary at the scheduler's colocation host; HRW = replica set:
  journal-ship to top-(R−1) successors, promotion order = the HRW list, no
  data-path election; HRW enters scheduler locality scoring as preference);
  hecate-wire gains batched-existence + group-granular fetch/repair verbs;
  laptop = inventory of one, identical formulas, no modes; (g) the
  single-guest-protocol advantage (Linux guest on every host OS ⇒ one serving
  protocol; EdenFS's FUSE/NFS/ProjFS three-protocol matrix structurally
  absent) — verify against libkrun/HVF/WHP findings. Research LANDED ×4:
  EdenFS internals (overlay thrift schema, inode dual-map, metadata-only
  journal, takeover, the 3-OS pain record); CitC/Piper (snapshot-on-save
  verbatim, <10-file overlay, 2011 read-tier recipe: stat from metadata +
  digests-as-xattrs, 500–800K QPS mostly build systems, zero-copy CI);
  virtio-fs/DAX (witnessing enforceable via per-inode dax=inode +
  FUSE_ATTR_DAX + EROFS on WRITE mappings — shipped mechanisms; in-process
  device dissolves reconnect; managed-window copy mode = portable fallback;
  multiqueue 5.5×; our fork = only 3-platform DAX in existence); sharded CAS
  (flat weighted HRW à la Buildbarn, chunk-groups + upmap exception table,
  pack volumes + batch existence checks, groupcache single-flight/mirroring,
  MinIO/Ceph/SeaweedFS parameter-degeneration no-modes receipts, MinIO FS-mode
  removal as the mode-bifurcation record). Next: (b) overlay representation.
- **Walking skeleton** — final branch; re-presents against completed tree
  (P0 wire → P1 runtime → P2 spine → P3 pod leg → P4 first agent → P5 first
  merged change; now must thread Sibyl/home-session/lineage into first light;
  each rung carries fault-matrix cells).
- Small owed: full "Guide summons" language sweep (key sites corrected; grep
  pass owed); ADR candidates (sessions/lineage+landing engine; deterministic
  optimism; forest; open roster/offices) — offer per ADR rules.

## Cost ledger (accepted burdens; check every new decision against these)

Owned wheels: runtime+SIM, claims protocol, hecate-wire codec, merge engine +
verdict theorem, **landing engine (a second merge machine — distinct verdict
surface: eg-walker replay + jj conflict algebra; accepted deliberately, opposite
regime from the gate)**, **the serving machine (FUSE-over-virtio layer +
log-structured overlay + mapping engine; rides owned WAL/chunk-store/fork —
new surface, not a new stack)**, Z-set field engine, forked VMM stack (WHP =
risk cell), sharded scheduler. Managed-window mapping mode = deliberate
portability concession (one copy per 2 MiB miss on unproven platforms; the one
mode where DAX + full witnessing coexist). Compounding: walking-skeleton first light is far behind the wheel
count — acknowledged repeatedly, accepted under "we do not fear complexity."
Other standing costs: encrypt-always CPU; per-increment validation; max/ultra
primary models; full-machinery-locally (degenerate consensus, session infra
floor — ratcheted budget); shard-local placement optimality (slow rebalancer);
two-phase arena lookups; tokio ecosystem cut off (blocking rustls egress).
